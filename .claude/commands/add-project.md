Help me add a new project to the portfolio section on index.html:
1. Ask the user for:
   - Project name
   - Project description
   - Project URL (if applicable)
   - Image filename (should be placed in /images/)
2. Find the "My Projects" section in index.html
3. Add the new project following the existing HTML structure and Tailwind CSS styling
4. Show the user the changes made
